# Data Analysis and Scientific Computing with Python Projects

This repository contains projects completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python and Scientific Computing with Python certifications.

## Projects

### Data Analysis with Python

- **Project 1:** Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
  - Calculates the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value, and sum of a 3x3 matrix using the NumPy library. 
- **Project 2:** Demographic Data Analyzer:
  - Analyzes demographic data using Pandas DataFrame.
- **Project 3:** Medical Data Visualizer
  - Analyzes and visualizes medical data using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- **Project 4:** Page View Time Series Visualizer
  - Analyzes time series data of Wikipedia page views using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- **Project 5:** Sea Level Predictor
  - Analyzes and visualizes historical data of the Earth's sea level using Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.

### Scientific Computing with Python
- **Project 1:** Arithmetic Formatter
  - A function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically. 
- **Project 2:** Time Calculator
  - A function that adds a duration to a start time and returns the result.
